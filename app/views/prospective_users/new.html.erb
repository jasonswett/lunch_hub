<h1>Lunch Hub</h1>

<p>
  Tell me if this sounds familiar: you're feeling a little stir crazy at your desk
  and you want to get out of the office for lunch. You ask your buddy Andy if he has any lunch plans.
  "Man, I wish I could," he says, "but I gotta get some stuff done."
</p>

<p>
  So you walk over to Dave's desk but he's gone. "Has anybody seen Dave?" you ask. Nobody knows where Dave went. Frickin' Dave.
</p>

<p>
  Finally, you convince Andy to cave and come along, but only if you go to Bangkok Taste.
  You stop by Mike's desk on the way out and ask if he wants to join. "Where are you guys going?" Mike asks.
  "Bangkok Taste," you say. Just then, Nate, Steve, Alex walk through the door. "Hey, where did you guys go for lunch?"
  you ask. "Bangkok Taste!" Nate shouts. <i>You guys could have all just gone together!</i>
</p>

<p>
  Wouldn't it be nice to just be able to <b>see who's up for lunch</b> each day so you don't have to think about it?
